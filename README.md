# quora-no-login
Chrome extension: Read Quora questions without having to log in or sign up.

A simple chrome extension that automatically 'redirects' to the question url(if a question was clicked, this way the page doesn't fully load more than once) and as a fallback procedure, reloads the page if the quora login modal is found.
